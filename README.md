# Goit-react-hw-04-feedback

## Description

This project is a simple feedback collection application built with React. It allows users to provide feedback by clicking on different feedback options: good, neutral, or bad. The application keeps track of the feedback statistics, including the total count of feedback and the percentage of positive feedback. The code has been updated and refactored using useState and useEffect, enabling more efficient state management and responsiveness to changes.
